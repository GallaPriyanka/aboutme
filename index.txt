I started my Masters in Applied Computer Science at the NorthWest Missouri State University, this Spring 2019. I should be graduating for my post graduation by the end of Fall 2020.

I am from a town called Guntur (in Andhra Pradesh), India. All my schooling took place in my hometown. I pursued my Under Graduation (BTech) in Computer Science and Engineering(CSE) at RVR & JC College of Engineering, Guntur. Later I worked for the Tata Consultancy Service(TCS) as a DataBase developer for 1.5 years. My job included working on technologies like SQL, PLSQL, Unix and Informatica. I spend my free time by solving sudoku, puzzles and mystery riddles.

My dream is to get into the Google company as a developer. I want to be a Java or DataBase developer because I am very much interested in Java and SQL programming and DataBase Management Systems(DBMS). I like the work that involves programming and solving problems with creative thinking.

I like to spend more time with my family and help my parents in their work. I always want to make them as proud of me as I was of them.
